          Dear %{user_name},
  
          You have been invited to join the %{service_name} service for %{organisation_name}.
  
          Use this service to register your schoolâ€™s ability to offer school placements for trainee teachers.
          
          This helps teacher training providers know whether to contact you and helps the Department for Education understand school capacity to support teacher training.
          
          This service is being trialled by the Department for Education with schools and teacher training providers in England.
