          Dear %{user_name},
  
          You have been invited to join the %{service_name} service for %{organisation_name}.
  
          Use this service to register your school’s ability to offer school placements for trainee teachers.
          
          This helps teacher training providers know whether to contact you and helps the Department for Education understand school capacity to support teacher training.
          
          This service is being trialled by the Department for Education with schools and teacher training providers in England.

          If you do not have DfE Sign-in, create an account. You can then return to this email to access the service.

        subject: "Reminder: Record Your School’s interest in hosting ITT placements"
        body: |
          Dear %{user_name},
          
          A couple of weeks ago, we let you know about the Department for Education’s new [Find Placement Schools](%{sign_in_url}) service - designed to make it quicker and easier for you to record your school’s ability to host trainee teachers on placements.
          
          We’ve noticed your school hasn’t yet signed in. To get started, your DfE Sign-in approver should have received an on-boarding email and can log in and add other users if needed.

          ## Please take a moment to:
            
          1. Sign in using your DfE Sign-in credentials
          
          2. Record your preferences for hosting placements
          
          3. Add any extra details you’d like to share (e.g. phase, subject)
          
          Sharing your preferences makes it easier for ITT providers to connect with your school if you’re interested in hosting placements - or lets them know you’re not able to host placements at the moment.
          
          You can update your information at any time, and we’ll send reminders to help keep it current.
          
          If you have any questions or feedback, please contact us at [%{support_email}](mailto:%{support_email}).
          
          Many thanks,

          Dear %{user_name},
          
          Thank you for signing in to the Department for Education’s new [Find Placement Schools](%{sign_in_url}) service. 
          
          We’ve noticed your school hasn’t yet recorded its ability to host trainee teachers on placements. Sharing your preferences helps ITT providers connect with your school if you're interested in hosting placements - and lets them know if you're not currently able to.

          ## To complete your expression of interest:
          
          1. Sign in using your DfE Sign-in credentials
          
          2. Record your preferences for hosting placements
          
          3. Add any extra details you’d like to share (e.g. phase, subject)
          
          You can update your information at any time, and we’ll send reminders to help keep it current.
          
          If you have any questions or feedback, please contact us at [%{support_email}](mailto:%{support_email}).
          
          Many thanks,
