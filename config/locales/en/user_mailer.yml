          Dear %{user_name},
          
          You are invited to sign in to the %{service_name} service for %{organisation_name}.
          
          Please sign in this week to register your school's ability to offer school placements for trainee teachers. If you are not the right staff member to do this, sign in to the service now to add the appropriate colleague(s) as a user.
          
          This is not a commitment to offer school placements but it helps teacher training providers know whether to contact you and helps the Department for Education understand school capacity to support teacher training.
          
          This service is being trialled by the Department for Education with schools and teacher training providers in England.

          Dear %{user_name},
          
          Thank you for signing in to the Department for Education’s new Find Placement Schools service.
          
          We’ve noticed your school hasn’t yet recorded its ability to host trainee teachers on placements in academic year 2026/27. Please sign in to the service and record this information as soon as you can.
          
          This is not a commitment to offer school placements but it helps teacher training providers know whether to contact you and helps the Department for Education understand school capacity to support teacher training.
          
          You can update your information at any time, and we’ll send reminders to help keep it current.
          
          If you have any questions or feedback, please contact us at [%{support_email}](mailto:%{support_email}).
          
          Many thanks,
